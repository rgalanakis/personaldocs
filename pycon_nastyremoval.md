# Audience
Veteran programmers who want to make things better, junior programmers who want to avoid making things worse. 

# Objectives
Attendees will have gotten some real-world insight on when reinventing the wheel is appropriate, and how to address cultural and technical problems when such a solution becomes inappropriate. The technical aspects of Nasty and its removal will be covered as well.

# Description
In the days of Python 1.5, programmers at CCP working on the MMORPG EVE Online decided to implement a custom Python import mechanism, appropriately named "Nasty". Over the course of the next decade, they found this to be a very bad idea. The story of the creation and destruction of Nasty is one of success, fall, and redemption. It will hopefully inspire you in your own fight against legacy code. 

# Abstract
It is rare for a clever technical solution to be applicable a decade later. Unfortunately it is also quite common that these "jewels" become entrenched and unremovable, leading to suffering for the people maintaining the code. This is  

# Outline
I actually just plan on correlating the presentation to the Star Wars Skywalker plot line, so I'll include the analog for each step. I feel it works on many levels, including Nice as the Luke to Nasty as Anakin, but more importantly as the next generation of developers like Rob taking the torch from the old guard like Kristjan. And also the old guard ascending to misunderstood deity.

I've spoken at Game Developers Conference and in more local and work groups many times. Unfortunately GDC is not a non-profit so access to their "vault" of recordings requires a subscription.
